# Nathan Ben David - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

Hi! I'm Nathan, a young motivated Data Analyst looking for his next endeavor.<br>A lil about me before we jump to qualifications and so;
I like Data, Seriously, i Do!<br>
I Enjoy going on to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) every now and then, exploring a random data set,
analysing it, and come up with my own conclusions regarding it; Sometimes i'll even have business ideas based solely on the SQL analysis of the database.<br>
Besides that weird hobby of mine (right?!), I enjoy statsitics (especially weird correlations like in here : [tylervigen.com](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations))
and the Brain Science Field (if you do also, I HIGHLY encourage you to give 'The Brain That Changes Itself a read) as well as modelling data regarding that field using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn Libraries in Python.<br>
professionaly speaking, I hold a B.sc in Data-Science; During my studies, I gained the ability to work with complex data and developed an eye for identifying patterns and trends.<br> I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.<br>
Besides my acadmic knowledge and tools, I also have a proffesional background in working as a data analyst where I gained most of my knowledge, skills and tools.
## Skills used:
- **Python Modeling**: data preprocessing, and automation
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability


# Order Classification and Risk Analysis for E-commerce<br>

for the code click [here](main.py)


**Goal:**<br>
The project aims to establish a classification threshold that approves 90% of orders, <br>
analyze order distributions, and assess various business metrics to inform decisions on profitability, pricing, and risk factors <br>
associated with chargebacks and different product types (digital vs. tangible).


**Description:**<br>
This code performs a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce order data from a CSV file.<br>
Key tasks include calculating an approval threshold, visualizing order distribution, analyzing revenue-related metrics, assessing <br>
product risk by type, and extracting insights on customer behavior and order sources.
